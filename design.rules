# Design Rules

## 0. Consistency Across All Pages
- All pages must follow these design rules.
- Layouts, spacing, and component usage must be consistent across all pages.
- Reuse design patterns and components to ensure a unified look and feel.
- Any new page or feature should match the established design system and visual language.

## 1. Color Palette
- Use the official brand colors for primary, secondary, and accent elements.
- Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background (WCAG AA minimum).
- Use neutral colors for backgrounds and surfaces.
- Document all color hex codes and usage examples.

## 2. Typography
- Use the approved font family (e.g., Inter, Roboto, or system font stack).
- Define font sizes, weights, and line heights for headings, body, captions, etc.
- Maintain consistent vertical rhythm and spacing.
- Avoid using more than two font families.

## 3. Spacing & Layout
- Use a consistent spacing scale (e.g., 4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px).
- Apply spacing tokens via CSS variables or utility classes.
- Use a 12-column grid for desktop layouts; stack columns on mobile.
- Maintain consistent gutters and margins between elements.

## 4. Components
- Follow atomic/component-driven design (buttons, cards, forms, etc.).
- Use reusable components for common UI patterns.
- Document component states: default, hover, active, disabled, focus.
- Ensure all components are accessible (keyboard, screen reader, etc.).

## 5. Iconography
- Use a consistent icon set (e.g., Heroicons, Material Icons).
- Match icon stroke width and size across the UI.
- Use SVGs for scalability and accessibility.
- Provide alt text or aria-labels for meaningful icons.

## 6. Imagery
- Use high-quality, optimized images (JPG, PNG, or WebP).
- Maintain consistent aspect ratios for images in galleries or cards.
- Use descriptive alt text for all images.
- Avoid using text in images unless necessary.

## 7. Accessibility
- Ensure color contrast meets WCAG AA standards.
- Provide visible focus indicators for all interactive elements.
- Use semantic HTML for structure and meaning.
- Test designs with screen readers and keyboard navigation.

## 8. Responsive Design
- Design for mobile first, then scale up to tablet and desktop.
- Define breakpoints (e.g., 640px, 768px, 1024px, 1280px).
- Ensure layouts adapt gracefully to all screen sizes.
- Avoid fixed widths; use relative units (%, rem, em) where possible.

## 9. Brand Assets
- Use the official logo and brand assets as provided.
- Maintain clear space around the logo.
- Do not alter logo colors, proportions, or orientation.
- Store all brand assets in a central location (e.g., /public/brand/).

## 10. Animation & Motion
- Use subtle, purposeful animations to enhance UX (e.g., button hover, modal open).
- Keep animation durations short (100â€“300ms).
- Use CSS transitions or keyframes for smooth effects.
- Avoid excessive or distracting motion.
- Provide reduced motion options for accessibility.
- For advanced UI/UX, use Framer Motion or a similar animation library:
  - Prefer declarative animation APIs for maintainability.
  - Use spring and easing curves for natural movement.
  - Animate presence and transitions for modals, tooltips, and page changes.
  - Test animations for performance and accessibility (respects prefers-reduced-motion).

_Remember: Consistency and accessibility are key to great design!_
